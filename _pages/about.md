Hello! My name is Katie and I’m a healthcare worker of the millennial generation. In 2006 I was diagnosed with Restless Legs Syndrome and I’ve been tossing and turning ever since 😉.

As someone with a medical background, I’ve searched for explanations and treatments and longed for answers to this diagnosis that was quite literally keeping me up at night (note: I am NOT a doctor, and I cannot give medical advice).

Dealing with the symptoms of RLS is a journey and one that I hope you will join me on!

My partner bringing these posts to your screen is Vinny. He’s a talented software engineer (lucky me, hey?) who puts up with the crankiness and mood swings my sleepless nights can bring.

Hopefully together we can build a *Well Rested* community!
